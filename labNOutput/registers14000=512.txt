          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 39.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to    
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          3.95 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp  
          State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 85.9 cycles being stalled waiting for the L1 instruction queue    
          for local and global (LG) memory operations to be not full. Typically, this stall occurs only when executing  
          local or global memory instructions extremely frequently. Avoid redundant global memory accesses. Try to      
          avoid using thread-local memory by checking if dynamically indexed arrays are declared in local scope, of if  
          the kernel has excessive register pressure causing by spills. If applicable, consider combining multiple      
          lower-width memory operations into fewer wider memory operations and try interleaving memory operations and   
          math instructions. This stall type represents about 54.9% of the total average of 156.4 cycles between        
          issuing two instructions.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 65.8 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on  
          a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited     
          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 42.1% of the total average of 156.4 cycles
