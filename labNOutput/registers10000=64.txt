    OPT   Memory is more heavily utilized than Compute: Look at the Memory Workload Analysis section to identify the L1 
          bottleneck. Check memory replay (coalescing) metrics to make sure you're efficiently utilizing the bytes      
          transferred. Also consider whether it is possible to do more work per memory access (kernel fusion) or        
          whether there are values you can (re)compute.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 34.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to    
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          1.70 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.03 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp  
          State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 54.5 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on  
          a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited

          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 92.1% of the total average of 59.2 cycles
