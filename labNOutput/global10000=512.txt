          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 20.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to    
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          3.89 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.06 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp  
          State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 53.8 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on  
          a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited     
          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 68.4% of the total average of 78.7 cycles        
          between issuing two instructions.
